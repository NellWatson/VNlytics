# VNlytics
  VNlytics is a narrative analytics system for story based games. It enables player choices to be recorded for developer analysis, or additionally returned to the player, to compare their choices with others.

  It is a continuation of https://github.com/NellWatson/old-VNlytics. This repo is only kept for historical purposes.
